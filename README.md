# H-Bridge Inverter using Simulink

This project presents the simulation of an H-Bridge inverter for **DC to AC conversion** using MATLAB Simulink. It is a part of our academic coursework in Electrical and Electronics Engineering.

## 📁 Files

- `H bridge/`: Contains the Simulink model of the H-Bridge inverter.

## ⚙️ Project Description

An H-Bridge inverter is a power electronics circuit that converts DC to AC. It consists of four switches arranged in a bridge configuration to control the direction of current through the load, allowing AC output from a DC source.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- MATLAB Simulink (R2021a or later)
